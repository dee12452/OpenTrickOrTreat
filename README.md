# OpenTrickOrTreat
A work in progress (WIP), open source recreation of the cartoon network online flash game Operation T.R.I.C.K. Or T.R.E.A.T. written in C++ using SDL2.

As of now you can still play the game using a program called [Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint) if you don't want to wait to play this awesome game again.
